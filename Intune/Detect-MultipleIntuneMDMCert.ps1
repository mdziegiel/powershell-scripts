SCRIPT      : Detect-MultipleIntuneMDMCert
SYNOPSIS    : This script checks the Local Machine certificate store for
              multiple Intune MDM Device CA certificates
DESCRIPTION : This script checks the Local Machine certificate store for
              multiple Intune MDM Device CA certificates. If more
              than one certificate is found, it indicates a
              remediation is needed. Used as a detection script in
              Intune…
